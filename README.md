## üìå Notes
- Bash is required to run this script. On Windows, install a Bash environment such as **Git Bash**, **WSL**, or **MSYS2**.
- Make sure you have a JavaScript runtime installed ‚Äî either **Node**, **Deno**, or **Bun**.
- The alias step is optional. You can also run it directly with `[node|deno|bun] [nm-rm dir] [target dir]`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
- Do **not** use this script in directories you don‚Äôt fully control or recognize. Many applications (e.g., Electron based apps, system tools, and IDEs) use `node_modules` in critical internal directories. Deleting them may break software functionality.
- The author is **not responsible** for any damage or data loss caused by misuse of this script.
